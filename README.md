# process-observers

MATLAB scripts for simulating process observers for online state estimation and sensor fusion.

## Contents

Observers currently included:
- [luenberger_filter.m](luenberger_filter.m) - Luenberger observer (steady-state)
- [kalman_filter_ss.m](kalman_filter_ss.m) - steady-state Kalman filter
- [kalman_filter.m](kalman_filter.m) - dynamic Kalman filter

Multi-model observers:
- [mkf_filter.m](mkf_filter.m) - general purpose multi-model Kalman filter
- [mkf_filter_RODD.m](mkf_filter_RODD.m) - multi-model Kalman filter for state estimation in the presence of randomly-occurring deterministic disturbances (RODDs) as described in Robertson et al. (1995).

## Tutorial

See the following LiveScript for an introduction on how to use these functions:
