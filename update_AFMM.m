function obs = update_AFMM(obs, uk, yk)
% obs = update_AFMM(obs) updates the multi-model Kalman
% filter using the adaptive forgetting through multiple
% models (AFMM) method and calculates the estimates of
% the states and output at the next sample time.
%
% Sequence pruning method as described in Eriksson and
% Isaksson (1996):
% - At the updates, let only the most probable sequence,
%   i.e. with the largest weight of all the sequences
%   split into 2 branches.
% - After the update is completed, remove the sequence
%   with the smallest weight.
% - Renormalize the remaining weights to have unit sum.
%
% Restriction to above rules:
% - Do not cut branches immediately after they are born.
%   Let there be a certain minimum life length for all 
%   branches.
%
% Arguments:
%   obs : struct containing the multi-model Kalman filter
%       variables (see function mkf_filter).
%   uk : vector (nu, 1) of system inputs at the current 
%       sample time.
%   yk : vector (ny, 1) of system output measurements
%       at the current sample time.

    % Filter pruning algorithm
    %
    % - As described in Eriksson and Isaksson (1996):
    %
    %   "Do not cut branches immediately after they are 
    %    born. Let there be a certain minimum life length 
    %    for all branches."
    %
    % To implement this rule, filters are organized into
    % two groups:
    % 
    %  1. Main group : obs.filters{f} for f in obs.f_hold
    %     Longer-surviving filters which can be killed off.
    %  2. Holding group : obs.filters{f} for f in obs.f_main
    %     Recently created filters which cannot be killed 
    %     off and are held for n_min time periods before
    %     being transferred to the main group.
    %
    % Note that for n_dist input disturbances, n_dist new
    % sequences are created each time step, so the
    % holding group needs to be n_dist*obs.n_min in size.

    % Index of current most likely sequence
    [~, f_max] = max(obs.p_seq_g_Yk);

    % Set next sequence value to 0 (no shock) for all
    % sequences
    for f = 1:obs.n_filt
        obs.seq{f}(:, obs.i_next(1)) = 0;
    end

    % Number of disturbances
    n_dist = size(obs.epsilon, 1);

    % Indices of least likely sequences in main group
    [~, f_order] = sort(obs.p_seq_g_Yk(obs.f_main));
    f_min = f_order(1:n_dist);

    % Replace least-likely filter(s) in main group
    % with oldest filter(s) in holding group
    f_old = n_dist*(obs.n_min-1)+1:n_dist*obs.n_min;
    f_replace = obs.f_main(f_min);
    obs.f_main(f_min) = obs.f_hold(f_old);
    obs.f_hold(f_old) = f_replace;

    % Shuffle observers in holding group
    obs.f_hold = circshift(obs.f_hold, n_dist);

    % Split most probable filter and add new 
    % filter(s) to holding group
    for i = 1:n_dist
        label = obs.filters{f_replace(i)}.label;
        obs.filters{f_replace(i)} = obs.filters{f_max};
        obs.filters{f_replace(i)}.label = label;
        obs.p_seq_g_Yk(f_replace(i)) = obs.p_seq_g_Yk(f_max);
        obs.p_gamma_k(f_replace(i)) = obs.p_gamma_k(f_max);
        obs.p_seq_g_Ykm1(f_replace(i)) = obs.p_seq_g_Ykm1(f_max);
        obs.seq{f_replace(i)} = obs.seq{f_max};
        % Set next sequence value to 1 (shock)
        obs.seq{f_replace(i)}(:, obs.i_next(1)) = i;
    end

    % TODO: Add online noise variance estimation with
    % forgetting factor as described in Anderson (1995)
    % equation (4.3).

    % Run generic MKF updates and probability calcs first
    obs = update_MKF(obs, uk, yk);
